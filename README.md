# Sign-language-recognition

Abstract:

"Inability to speak is considered to be true disability". People with this disability use different modes of communication. one such common method of communication is SIGN LANGUAGE. Developing sign language application for deaf people is very important, as theyâ€™ll be able to communicate easily both within and with others. This project aims at taking the basic step in bridging the communication gap between normal people, deaf/dumb people using sign language. The main focus of this work is to create a vision based system to identify sign language gestures from the video sequences. Bag of words and CNN (convolutional neural network) algorithms were implemented indepenently and their results were compared.

The reason for choosing a system based on vision relates to the fact that it provides a simpler and more intuitive way of communication between a human and a computer. In this work, ASL (American sign language dataset) was utilized. The data consists 24 different gestures.
